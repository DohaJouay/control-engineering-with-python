### Prerequisites

  - Ordinary Differential Equations and Linear Algebra
    (undergraduate level).

  - Scientific Computing skills with the Python/SciPy stack.

  - Experience in a domain where control engineering is useful:
    either Mechanical Engineering, 
    Electrical Engineering, Process Engineering, etc. 

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

  - understand and apply the theoretical foundations of control systems,

  - use common numerical methods in control engineering,

  - leverage the control engineering perspective in application domains.

### Calendar

The course is composed of 3 periods of 2 days (with a 6-hour workday), 
separated by at least two weeks. The typical student workload should be
in the 75--90 hour range (including the 36 hours of face-to-face teaching).

Accordingly, the course is decomposed in three parts:

 1. Dynamical Systems: Models, Properties, Simulation.

 2. Controllers and Observers Design.

 3. Control Engineering for Mobile Robotics.

While parts 1 and 2 are considered standard for such an introductory course, 
part 3 is merely one possible field of application of control engineering; 
it could be replaced or complemented with alternate topics in the future.

### Course Material

A custom set of resources supports the course objectives 
with the following characteristics:

  - Digital First: all documents are available in digital form;
    they use the English language.

  - Open Knowledge: the course material is
    freely available under a permissive license.

  - Reproducible Education: the design process 
    enable and fosters reuse and modification 
    of the course material.

### Software Stack & Educational Technology

The software tools used to solve control engineering problems
belong to the [Python/SciPy ecosystem](https://www.scipy.org/). 
Mostly:

  - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) for numerical arrays,

  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization,

  - The [Scipy library](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/) for
    ODEs, LTI systems, Linear Algebra, etc.

We also rely on [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to define
executable documents. Notebooks can behave mostly like classic documents,
but they can also embed some editable and executable code that produces 
some dynamic content. 

### Pedagogy & Team

To provide a hands-on experience, the course contains 
at least 50% tutorials or lab sessions in small groups.
We use notebooks as a complement of classic documents, since they
foster experimentation and active learning for students.
The third and more applied part of the course should also 
contribute positively to the engagement of the less mathematically 
inclined students.

Teachers in the pedagogical team are knowledgeable 
with the mathematics of control theory, 
the software stack used in the course 
and the application domain selected in its last part. 

### Assignments & Assessment

An assignment is associated to each part of the lecture; 
it complements the tutorial and lab sessions.
The corresponding deliverable is a notebook that shall
be produced at most two weeks after the end of the part.
Up to 1/3 of the final mark will be based on the 
interactions with the teachers during the course.
